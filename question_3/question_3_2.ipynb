    "- The histograms for all measurements, except for pH and density, exhibit a right-skewed distribution. This means that the majority of data points are skewed towards lower values, with a long tail on the higher value side, indicating a positive skew.\n",
    "- In contrast, the histograms for pH and density display a bell-shaped or approximately symmetric distribution. This suggests that data values are evenly spread around the central tendency, with no strong skew in either direction."
